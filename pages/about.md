 A dynamic Mechanical Engineering graduate from Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, Mysuru, with a solid background in Mechanical Engineering and strong passion for robotics and autonomous systems. 

 During my undergraduate studies, I led a 30-member SAE E-Baja Off-road Racing Team, managing software, simulation, and hardware domains, and engineered a 40% weight reduction in the chassis using SolidWorks. Under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. G.V. Naveen Prakash, I worked on projects like Exoskeletons using Pneumatic Cylinders and an Autonomous Delivery Robot, which fueled my interest in robotics. My fascination with off-road autonomous vehicles and mobile robots led me to further specialize by completing Udacityâ€™s Robotics Software Nanodegree Program and attending a ROS summer camp at Dubai Future Labs.

 My skills include programming in Python, C++. In robotics, I have experience with ROS1/2, Gazebo, RViz, MoveIt, OpenCV, SLAM and Computer Vision. Additionally, I have expertise in Mechanical Design and Analysis using Inventor, Fusion360, SolidWorks, ANSYS. I am proficient in Linux, Git, CMake and MATLAB software. 
 
 I am now seeking internship or full-time opportunities in robotics and autonomous   systems.
